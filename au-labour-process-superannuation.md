## Superannuation Overview

There are two (2) options available in relation to setting up Superannuation within Dynamics NAV Payroll and Labour Hire module and this will depend upon whether the rate that you pay your candidates is inclusive or exclusive of the SGC component. This section will summarise where superannuation is treated as an On cost (SGC is exclusive of the pay rate).

Within the Dynamics NAV Payroll and Labour Hire module, Superannuation is accrued as an On Cost transaction to facilitate itinerant staff hired within the Recruitment industry.  

The Superannuation On Cost transaction will either be stored on the Rate Set of a Job whereby the cost of the superannuation will be allocated back to a Job No. or otherwise stored on the Payroll Employee. 

Salary Sacrifice and Post Tax deductions are entered via the Employee Deductions area of the Payroll Employee card and will be generated on a pay-by-pay basis when the candidate’s pay is processed.

When the pays are calculated, the superannuation on cost transaction is generated within the pay journal based upon the transactions
contained in the journal and if the candidate has any superannuation deductions, these are also generated at this during this process.    

After the journal has been validated, posting the pay journal will update the General Ledger and Employee Ledger Entry tables and if a Job No. is specified against the on cost transaction, the Job Ledger Entry is also updated. The General Ledger is updated with an expense and provisional transaction when the pays are posted and this is automatically re-adjusted when the superannuation is posted at the end of the month.

The Calculate Monthly Superannuation report is designed to be processed at the end of each calendar month whereby a recalculation will occur to see if the candidate hasmet the SGC rules setup on the Payroll Setup card.  The transactions are sourced from the Employee Ledger Entry table where the pays were previously posted to and if the candidate meets the requirements, a superannuation ledger entry will be generated with the employee’s nominated fund, otherwise a threshold transaction is generated and will be posted to the Employee Ledger Entry and General Ledgers as a “Threshold Adjustment”.  

When you have completed generating your superannuation ledger entries, the next step is to perform the “Calculate & Post Superannuation” function which will post any threshold adjustments to the General Ledger and if you’ve opted for Vendor integration, an Invoice transaction will post to the Vendor Ledger Entry.

## SuperStream Payment Requirements

Under the Superannuation Guarantee you must pay superannuation contributions to the correct superannuation fund, by the cut off dates, for all your eligible employees.  

You may also be required to offer a choice of superannuation fund to your eligible employees.

The superannuation guarantee is administered on a self-assessing basis and there are laws requiring you to meet your superannuation obligations. It is your responsibility as an employer to ensure arrangements you have in place for your employees satisfy the government’s superannuation guarantee requirements.  

More information can be found on at the Australian Taxation Office website: http://www.ATO.gov.au.

Dialog Pty Ltd has developed the “Superannuation Payments” Module.  The module will allow you to produce a mail merge (.CSV) file or print the Superannuation payments on the employees next Pay Advice after you pay the fund.  

When an employee is not paid in the next pay run the module will allow you to produce a mail merge (.CSV) file to create a letter for the employee.

An export has been created to allow for New Member information to be remitted to the fund electronically which can be produced for an employee or a Payroll, Superannuation Fund Product. The export can be revised in preview mode which will highlight any missing information such as Membership and Address information.

There are 5 Superannuation Payment File options:

- [Generic](#generic-payment-format)
- [ClickSuper](#clicksuper-payment-format)
- [SuperChoice](#superchoice-payment-format)
- [SunSuper](#sunsuper-payment-format)
