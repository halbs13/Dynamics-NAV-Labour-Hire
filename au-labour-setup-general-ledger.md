## To set up Dimensions
A dimensions is a data that you can add to an entry as a kind of marker so that the program can group entries with similar characteristics and easily retrieve these groups for analysis purposes.  Dimensions can be used throughout the programs on entries in journals and documents, as well as budgets.

The term dimensions is used to describe how analysis occurs.  A two-dimensional analysis, for example, would be Sales Per Area.  However, by using more than two dimensions when creating an entry, you can carry out a more complex analysis at a later time, for example, sales per sales campaign per customer group per area.

Each dimension can have an unlimited series of dimension values that are sub-units of that dimension.  For example, a dimension called Department can have departments called Sales, Administration and so on as sub-units.  These departments are dimension values.  Dimensions and dimension values are user-defined and unlimited, which means you can create dimensions tailored to your company's needs and business processes.  However, some dimensions such as account number and date, are already defined for you by the program.

1. In the **Search** box, enter **Dimension**, and then choose the related link.
2. Fill the fields as described in the following table.
