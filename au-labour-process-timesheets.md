# How to process timesheets

## Introduction

Timesheet lines are used to generate invoices and pay contractors/employees for work that
has been performed on a Job.

The Labour Hire Timesheet module is unique where it can be configured so that the timesheet
lines once processed, can be invoiced prior to paying contractors/employees.  

Timesheets can generated on a pay-by-pay basis using the Automatic Timesheet Generation
process and are only generated where the placement date falls within that particular 
pay period.  

This document describes the various activities relating to Timesheets and contains the
following sections;

Labour Hire Setup – establishing the Timesheet Processing Method

## Timesheet Processing Method

The Timesheet processing method allows you todefine when the Timesheet lines are posted
against a job and ready for invoicing. There are 2 processing methods;

Timesheet – this method transfers the timesheet lines to the Job Planning Lines to allow
for invoices to be generated.  At the same time it also transfers the timesheet lines to
the Pay Journal Lines to allow for pays to be processed for contractors/employees. 
Implementing this method however prevents the timesheet lines in the pay journal lines 
from being modified.

Payroll – the method requires the user to import the timesheets into the Pay Journal. Once
the pays are calculated and posted, the Job Planning Lines are populated with the lines to
generate invoices.  Implementing this method allows for the timesheet lines to be modified
 in the pay journal.  

The Timesheet Processing Method is updated via the “Job Contract Posting Method”.

To access this field, go to the following menu:

Departments/Payroll/Setup/Labour Hire/Administration/Labour Hire Setup

Job Contract Posting Method – Select the required field :

  Timesheets
