## To setup Payroll Users
Payroll access is granted using the standard Microsoft Dynamics NAV User Security authorising the tables, forms, reports, and functions the user is allowed to access.   The Standard Security Groups for payroll are installed with the Payroll module when the Code Unit 16000401 Payroll Initialise Permissions is run.

Additional security is provided with the Payroll granule for Payroll Users.  After a user has been setup as a Payroll User  the Payroll User determines the Payrolls the user is allowed to access for data entry, processing, enquiry, and reporting.  The Payroll User Id is the same as the User Id used to log on to Microsoft Dynamics NAV.

A user can be authorised to only inquire on employees in a specific branch or division of the payroll to prevent the user accessing sensitive employee details.

Employees can be granted permissions to inquire on their own pay details.  Access is defined by creating a Microsoft Dynamics NAV User Id, an identical Payroll User Id and then entering the Employee User Id in the employee Payroll Employee Card.

Note:  This security is not replicated in the Human Resources granule.

## To setup Superannuation Products
Superannuation Products defines the default parameters used for Superannuation Processing including the calculations of employee and employer contributions to an unlimited number of Superannuation funds.

Generally, employees aged over the age of 18, who are paid $450 (before tax) or more in a calendar month are covered by the superannuation guarantee legislation, regardless of their type of employment.  

The Superannuation Guarantee Contribution (SGC) is a percentage of specific components of employees’ remuneration, called “Ordinary Time Earnings”. 

Superannuation contributions by either the employee or the employer are set up as a percentage of the employee’s pay (or base salary), or as a standard amount each pay period. The employer may also contribute a factor of the employee’s superannuation contribution.  Superannuation contribution can be set up to meet the minimum salary amount.  

When calculating Superannuation as a percentage of pay, the process uses the [pay transactions types](#how-to-setup-pay-transaction-types) that have the **Apply to Superannuation** field set to **Yes** on the parameters tab for the Standard Superannuation method and Employee contributions.

The payments of contributions to the superannuation funds are also recorded.  Payment can be set up to generate at the frequency required by the superannuation fund. Recorded against each Superannuation fund are the contributions made to it by the employee and employer.  

Manual changes can be made to superannuation contribution amounts for the employer or employee.  These changes will be recorded as transactions. On the Pay Journal one-off contributions to superannuation can be entered.

Cheques to the superannuation fund can be automatically printed from the system.  These can be set up to be a standard amount each month or the actual amount that has been contributed since the last payment was made.

# Award Overview

An Award is set up by:

- Defining the Award 
- Creating one or more Award Classifications 
- Creating Classification Rates for each Award Classification. 
- (Optional) At least one Award and Classification must be setup for each company to process the payrolls.  

The default Award is automatically created by the Initialisation Codeunit when payroll is implemented and is called “GENERAL” for both the Award and Classification: 

All employees Pay Rates are associated with the default Award until you create your own Awards and assign them to Employees. Setting up additional Awards and Classifications is optional. Awards are broken down into Classifications (Grades) that may apply for a specific period of service until they increment to a higher classification.  

Classifications may have Pay Rates that apply from a specified date. Each Classification can have the “Number of Months of Service” for which the Classification is applicable, and a “Next Classification” that applies on completion of the Number of Months.  When the specified “Number of Months of Service” is complete, an Employee is automatically incremented to the “Next Classification”.  

Each Classification can have an effective date specified for each Pay Rate that you can set to increment and apply to the Employee’s in the Classification Awards have a Weekly Rate and may have an Over Award Rate applied to Payroll Employees.

A second Over Award Rate added in addition to the Over Award Rate may be applied to individual Employees. Classifications may have additional Allowances generated for each Employee in a Classification.  These allowances are granted each Pay-run for those Employees.

Each Employee must be allocated to a Classification in order to obtain a rate of Pay.  

The date of Employment is used to determine the date from which to calculate the Employee length of service.

When the Payroll is processed and the rate is not set up in the Pay Transaction Type the following applies: 

The Classification of the Employee or the Classification entered against the Employee Hours in the pay journal is used to determine the Pay rate to assign to the Pay transaction.

Awards may have Associated Transactions. When a pay is run the Associated Transactions are generated for each Employee covered by the
Award.  These affect each Pay-run for Employees that falls within the date range of the Award Associated Transactions.  When the date fields are left blank no date limitation apply.

When an award has standard allowances (e.g. for uniforms) applicable to all persons on the payroll that are under that award, these can
be set up by creating Gross / Allowances for that Award.

On the Payroll Employee Card a second Over Award Rate can be added in addition to the Over Award Rate.

## To setup Award Classifications

The Award and Classifications menu options are only displayed after you flag the “Allow Award Pay Rates” check box in the “Payroll > Setup> Payroll Setup> Payroll Controls > Payroll Setup > Options FastTab”.

The Awards card is used to maintain Awards and to link the Award to Gross, Allowances, Associated Transactions, and Classifications. (For example shift allowances that apply to hours worked on a specific shift or to associate Leave Loading with Annual Leave.

# Leave Overview

You can set up unlimited Leave Types and Accruals.  Each employee can have more than one Leave Type and Accrual assigned to them. To setup the parameters for Leave you must setup:

- Types
- Accruals

After you setup the Types and Accrual rules you must assign them to your employees.  

Default Leave Codes and Types can be setup to default for each Payroll for Annual Leave, Leave Loading, Sick Leave, and Long Service
Leave.  The defaults are used for each Payroll Employee assigned to the Payroll. You can change and delete the defaults for the individual employees prior to their first pay on the Payroll Employee Card > Navigate Ribbon >Leave> Accruals if you require.

 
## Leave Examples

Leave Accruals can be one of the following types:

- Annual Leave
- Leave Loading
- Long Service Leave
- Sick Leave
- Other Leave
- Time in Lieu.

Each Type can have a different method of entitlement calculated dependant on the length of service.

### Example 1 

Annual Leave is setup to give the employee an Entitlement of four weeks on the first anniversary of employment.  

After the first year of service the calculation method automatically moves to Pro-rata and entitlement is granted according to the percentage of the leave period (Usually 12 months) that has passed. 

### Example 2 

Annual Leave is accrued as a percent of the rate of the employee’s pay for the first year of employment, and then accrued as days after
that time.  You can use this method to prevent an employee from being paid leave in the first year of employment, upon termination of employment; they are paid the value of their leave entitlement.
 
A period is the duration of the leave period for the leave accrual. Leave Accrual periods are setup in the system using Calculation
Methods for entitlement. 

- Pro-Rata
- Pro Rata Days Worked
- Pro Rata No Carry
- Anniversary
- Anniversary No Carry
- Percentage
- Percentage No Carry
- Return to Period

### Pro Rata Calculation
This Calculation Method calculates the number of days since the end of the previous period of service (N) and the total number of days in the current period (D). It uses the ratio of these two numbers (N/D) to calculate the proportion of leave entitlement for the period to accrue.

No. Days Accrued = No. Days Accrued Prior Periods + (No. Days to Date in Period / Total No. Days in Period) * No. Days leave entitlement
for the period.) 

Leave Rate = Ordinary Earnings Rate * Conversion Factor
   
### Pro-Rata Days Worked

This Calculation Method must be used for Leave based in hours and is the same as Pro-Rata except that the first number (N) is the
number of hours worked in the period. 
 
No. Days Accrued = No. Days Accrued Prior Periods + (No. Days worked in Period / Total Days in Period) * No. Days leave entitlement for the period.)

Leave Rate = Ordinary Earnings Rate * Conversion Factor.
   
### Pro-rata No Carry

This Calculation Method is the same as Pro-Rata except that it does not carry forward the previous period’s entitlement.

No. Days Accrued = (No. Days to day in Period / Total No. Days in Period) * No. Days leave entitlement for the period.)

Leave Rate = Ordinary Earnings Rate * Conversion factor.

### Anniversary

This Calculation Method uses the number of days in the entitlement on anniversary of the number of months for accrual.

When anniversary is reached then: No. Days Accrued = No Days Accrued Prior Period + No Days Entitlement for the period.

Leave Rate = Ordinary Earnings Rate * Conversion Factor
 
### Anniversary No Carry

This Calculation Method is the same as the Anniversary Calculation Method, except that it does not carry forward the previous period’s
entitlement. 

When anniversary is reached then:  No. Days Accrued = No. Days Entitlement.

  
### Percentage

This Calculation Method accrues an amount that is a percentage of ordinary earnings for the period. 

Leave Value = Leave Percentage * Ordinary Earnings

### Percentage No Carry

This Calculation Method is the same as Percentage Calculation Method, except that it does not carry forward the previous period’s
entitlement.

### Return to Period 

Loop back to a previous period.

The end of the previous period is determined using the starting Award Period No. on the Employee Leave Accrual Table.

Where the method “Percentage” or “Percentage No Carry” is used, the percentage to divide the ordinary earnings must be set up.  These earnings can be made to exclude over award amounts.

Where days are to be accrued at half pay, a conversion factor can be set-up against the leave type.  This conversion factor will affect the value of the entitlement. 

In order to track leave taken for leave accruals, pay transaction types must be set up to “apply to leave taken” against the leave
accrual codes.

Annual Leave can be accrued according to any of the above Calculation Methods.  A maximum number of days to accrue can also
be entered.

Leave Loading may be setup as a separate leave type, or as part of “Another leave” type.  When leave loading is setup, a transaction
type to use for generated leave loading must be entered with a percentage-loading factor.  A maximum salary to calculate loading percentage against can be setup. 

Long Service Leave may be accrued according to any of the above Calculation Methods.  LSL may be set-up to appear on reports after
a set number of years.  A specific LSL percentage to report for the first number of years of service may be set up.

Sick Leave can use any of the Calculation Methods for entitlement calculation.  A maximum number of days to accrue can be set-up against sick leave accruals.
 
Time in Lieu entitlement is calculated using the employee’s average hours and worked hours. 

Time in Lieu Hours Accrued formula = (Hours Worked – Average Hours) / Hours Worked.

In order to calculate the hours accrued for a pay period, the result of this formula is multiplied by the hours worked in the pay period
(determined by the pay transactions that are flagged as “Apply to Time in Lieu”). 

An accrual transaction is generated for the employee with a value of the calculated number of hours multiplied by the employee’s pay
rate.  The resulting value is used to reduce the employee’s pay for the period.

The transaction type to generate for accruals is entered on the Time in Lieu Setup table.

To enable tracking Time in Lieu taken, one or more pay transaction types must be set up as affecting the Time in Lieu Award.

The transaction used to take Time in Lieu can be set up to “Apply to Time in Lieu”.  This means that the user could enter 8 hours as the time taken, but only reduce the Entitlement by the formula result hours.

## Leave Types

Leave Types must be created before defining any Leave Accruals.  You can set up unlimited Leave Types.  

Leave Types can be one of the following types:

- Annual Leave
- Leave Loading
- Long Service Leave
- Sick Leave
- Other Leave

# On Costing Overview

An On Cost type transaction is a calculation of some type of overhead or Employer Liability transaction such as Payroll Tax, Workers Comp Levy, Insurance, Superannuation, etc. for example.

While some of these calculations may be possible using other methods, these are not all pay period type calculations and therefore no data is available for reporting purposes until end of month when the other calculation is performed.  By using On costing, the Employer is able to report on Wages plus on costs to get a true cost of labour as opposed to just having the wage component available.

As On Cost amounts are posted through to GL expense and provision accounts per pay period, the General Ledger is always up to date.

The functionalities of On Costing are;

- Allows a transaction type to be calculated as a percentage % of another transaction or accumulated value
- Allows double sided account entries – expense and provision account set up
- Allows the setup of a transaction type that does not affect the contractor’s pay – Employer Liability
- Allows on cost transactions to be automatically generated for a group of contractors under relevant conditions.

On Cost Setup encompasses the following activities:

- On Cost Accumulators – In order to be able to calculate on costs, there will need to be a base from which to calculate.  For example, if calculating on costs for the provision of annual leave, then you will need to base the calculation on the value of those types of incomes that accrue annual leave.  

To enable this, new Accumulators and Transaction Accumulators need to be setup and assigned to the appropriate transactions.

Transaction Accumulators – Are accessed via the Pay Transaction Type Card.  This option will allow the selection of as
many accumulators as required, to be attached to the selected pay transaction type code.

## On Cost Accumulators

1.  To access the On Cost Accumulators, go to the following menu: *Departments/Payroll/Setup/Payroll Setup/ General/Calculation
Accumulators* 

2. To create a new record, click on the **New** button.

## Posting Setup

During the Post Journal Lines process, General Ledger Accounts are resolved for each transaction where amounts will be consolidated
according to:

- GL Account
- Global Dimensions and Shortcut Dimensions

With On Cost transactions they are calculated and post both sides of the journal entry.  Where an amount of $20 is calculated, a debit entry is generated and posted to the nominated expense account and an equal credit entry is generated and posted to the nominated provision account.

Transaction Posting groups must be setup and specified to ensure that the provision and expense go the correct General Ledger account.

## On Cost Generation 
On Costs are generated automatically as there is a flag used to identify any transaction types that should be generated automatically if the code in question is found in the rateset applicable to the resource allocation.

### Calculate Pays
When the Calculate Pays function is run, the following process happens:

- Check Rateset for any transactions that are flagged as Auto Generate.
- Generate Transactions and calculate values based on rateset rate.  If there is no rateset rate found then the rate found on the Pay Transaction Type will be used. 

## Branch/Division/Global Dimensions/Shortcut Dimension

When the On Cost transactions are generated, Branch, Division, Global Dimension codes can be assigned automatically to the transactions.

## Labour Hire/PAYG Contractors

Where the option “Default Posting from Job flag” on the Labour Hire Tab on the Payroll is set to false, then it is a fairly straightforward procedure of finding the combination held on the Payroll Employee record and writing this combination on the on cost
journal line.

Where the “Default Posting from Job” flag is set to true, then the process becomes a lot more complicated.  Where there are multiple combinations then a new set of on cost transactions are generated.  The calculation will be performed per group.

For example, if an employee has worked on 2 different jobs that belong to 2 different departments in this period, then his transactions will be costed accordingly.
 
## Internal Employees

As Internal Employees are not necessarily assigned to Jobs the Branches and Dimensions will be inherited from the settings on the Payroll Employee Card or Transactional lines contained in the pay journal.

If the Dimensions for On Costs should always default from the Payroll Employee Card then you can set the “On Cost Dims. From Employee” flag to true, on the Options Tab of the Payroll card. 

 ### On Costing and Internal Employees

Internal employees are identified as administration staff, etc that are employed by the company.  It is assumed that Internal employees will use the base payroll function and rates will be setup via the Awards and Classifications structure.

On costing can also be set up for these types of employees in another area if rate sets are not being used.

Select the employee from the Payroll Employee Card – click on the “Navigate” ribbon > “Accumulation Calculations” > “Employer On Costs”.
