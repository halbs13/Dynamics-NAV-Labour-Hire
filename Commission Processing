To enable the breakup of amounts required in the second section of the report above, we will need to capture department and project for each transaction being included in the calculation and then split the end commission values accordingly.For example if the base contracting transactions were split between Optus – 38%, IBM – 27.5% and General – 34.5% and the commission calculated for an account manager for contract transactions was $5000 then this total amount will be split accordingly between the three projects.
